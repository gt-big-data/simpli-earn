## Git Practices

- Make a new branch for any feature addition formatted "initials/subteam/feature"
- Do not commit directly to main (even for small changes) so we can make sure the main branch remains error free. You should instead make a new branch off main, add the feature you are working on, and then open a pull request (and send it on Slack) so someone can review it
  - Sidenote: when you do this, you should git fetch & merge main into your local branch to make sure there aren't a lot of merge conflicts later on

Feel free to message Parth on Slack or text if you have any questions!

## General Info

As of April 16, 2025:

We demoed this project on April 15, 2025, at the BDBI Demo Day. It was a success overall, as we were able to showcase most of the intended features, such as a working stock chart and sentiment analysis on a preset library of transcripts, as well as the chatbot working on both the transcripts in the library and most YouTube links.

Improvements and future plans will be announced soon -- stay tuned!

To run the frontend, you need to have `npm` (installing this should be easy through a quick Google search) and should run `npm install -i` in the `frontend` folder.

To run the API, instructions are located in the `RAG_README.md` file in the `RAG` folder.

(This can be changed as per further instructions)
