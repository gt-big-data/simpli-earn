# Simpli-Earn

As of April 3, 2025:

Additional frontend improvements to fix the footer and summary generation were made, but you can now enter a YouTube link on the main page and see the summary generation and use SimpliChat as normal.

The video embed is also dynamic now. The Sentiment Analysis graph currently has dummy data, but clicking on the graph points does bring the video to those actual times.

Stock Chart functionality is still a work in progress.

To run the frontend, you need to have `npm` (installing this should be easy through a quick Google search) and should run `npm install -i` in the `frontend` folder.

To run the API, instructions are located in the `RAG_README.md` file in the `RAG` folder.

For other subteams, please clone this repository/make a branch and make a new folder for your subteam's code to avoid merge conflicts.

(This can be changed as per further instructions)
