# Simpli-Earn

As of April 2, 2025:

The RAG code has mostly been integrated with the frontend, and now chatting functionality with the library earnings calls works perfectly. It is now left to add functionality of entering a YouTube link.

Major frontend improvements were also made, such as fixing the dark text and ensuring chats persist when switching to/from full-screen and also when closing/reopening the window in the dashboard.

To run the frontend, you need to have `npm` (installing this should be easy through a quick Google search) and should run `npm install -i` in the `frontend` folder.

To run the API, instructions are located in the `RAG_README.md` file in the `RAG` folder.

For other subteams, please clone this repository/make a branch and make a new folder for your subteam's code to avoid merge conflicts.

(This can be changed as per further instructions)
