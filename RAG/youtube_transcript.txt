and here's M charma he's been one of the
finds of the uh the Pepsi IPL 19 wickets
here's the first
[Applause]
ball and that's the first
boundary just symbolic of the form he's
been
in no that's a close call up goes the
finger that's the first Wicket and it's
a huge one the Mumbai Indians have
Dwayne Smith Sil mcris you were saying
he's the danger man from the first over
and the Wicket last
ball oh Edge slid was standing wide what
a start to this final it's eight for
one oh the Chennai Super Kings are on
fire might have a bit of pad on it but
it doesn't matter the leg STS on the
ground Al Mor first ball have a look at
the spear and full at leg stump off that
pad onto the off stump more Co strikes
chenai struck twice very early inside of
seven balls in this final it's a big day
for Rohit Sharma he's been in good
form oh
de just checked his shot it's all going
the Chennai Super Kings how good is that
ball from Al Mel just checking the shot
but on the follow through he still had
to catch
it and he's gone through with a shot
comfortable comfortable catch they're
never that easy he's made it look very
simple as Al Mor but it's just stuck in
the Wicket a little bit not one you can
play your shots freely on and the Mumbai
Indian Skipper has paid the price caught
and
Bal that's
four blazing Su Sun
day oh he's dragged it on Dennis cark
all his hard work Has Come Undone and
it's his
doing we try and play on the up and if
the ball moves just a little bit as it
has in this instance just come in a
little
bit now into the equation batting at six
the formidable shape presence of kyum
poad West Indian Way
by banging the bail onto the
crease oh nice shot look at that timing
look at that timing
aish but it's nicely played by Ru and
he's playing a good Innings here for
Mumbai so anything around uh 140 150 I
think it would be good U because it is
much better but you he can do shots like
this which is amazing it's a big big hit
from paard yes Bank maximum into the
stands he makes it look so easy he just
backs himself when he's hitting
straight and he clears the ground quite
comfortably he's got a good record
against the Chennai Super Kings so into
a second over Bravo and he's bow him
once again straight away after the
Strategic timeout first ball and a
middle stump knock back in terms of
taking wickets in this tournament
straight after the
break he's down the Wicket and trying to
smash him and he can't get under that
Bravo celebrates
again he's got heaps of
wickets more than 140 would be
par short to P up this time pulls it
powerfully away for
for this once again coming in the arc
off his
swing out should be out Mike Hass you
don't see those go down when they go in
his Direction at all
that's good too for Morris they full
polard might come back for two keeper
end was the the
option good backing up good backing up
oh they're got to go and they're going
to run out miles out too good
work y isn't taken not a good enough
throw from the deep but he gets told get
it over to the Bowers end and Chris
Morris right by the Stomps tell you what
if he throw it to the keeper end po was
out by a long
way good over required by both Bravo
with the ball Johnson with the bat
necked and taken very good very
good nice work from mson the
skipper on target leaving the batsman
there it is just leaving him trying to
work the ball away to the onside good
diving catch that by the Chennai Super
Kings
Skipper oh and again and he's got
another one
Bravo he wants to get to the striker
end but he's just not getting the chance
Nick straightforward Nick look at where
PA has reached and he say he's very
upset what's Bravo going to do
personally you got to go full and wide
just inside that wide line and very full
goes straight goes down the ground and
gets hit half a
dozen what a way to bring up the
50 well the Yer gone wrong full toss and
that's all he needs that's the reason he
wanted to be at the Striker's end that's
the reason he was so upset will it go
for another
six and he does that's even bigger pick
the slow ball knew it was coming Bravo
has fed for the last couple and poad has
deposited him
back into the stands Mumbai Indians will
finish with
148 Dwayne Smith he got him early out
for four and the top of that scoreboard
didn't make for good reading until
amatti Ru kin poad got together for
their partnership 48 that was and 60 not
out for car and Pollard well sha man
that San just talked to 1 for
26 Alby Morel 2 for2 terrific spell from
him Bravo expensive but he did pick up
four wickets and Chris Morris who's been
exceptional throughout the season for
the Chennai Super Kings with one for 25
face of cricket I've never known a team
photograph requiring wide angle lens now
Mur vij can he ReDiscover form he's he's
done that at least two or three times in
the past on the big final there
go first
ball now direct it H he was moving like
as soon as he played the shot moving
like a
Flash oh he knocked him over what a
moment in this
match Michael hassi who's almost defined
the Chennai Super Kings this year and
the decision to give the new ball to L
malinga has work
dramatically we saw ad t fall to ful
length delivery this is a swinging
Yorker pitch is almost on the batting
cre another big game player Cly T20
cricket now what's that come off what
has that come off they're celebrating
he's going what a dramatic start this
is there it is and the Fielder was there
to take that catch this is also
excellent captaincy good
bowling well well not today how far away
with that ball three for
three front leg going nowhere hey aedge
straightforward cast to thees karik it's
all about pressure it's all about
pressure out in the center such a cat
and mouse thing
this he's got it away now try and figure
out how you can get that ball with that
body contortion out behind
Square only a West Indian can do it in
no position
but he still gets a boundary bit of
swivel uses his hands to good effect
Ling can't hold back his
smile and in the Gap and superbly timed
that's the ense of his
[Applause]
batting in the air simple catch soft
dismissal Mitchell Johnson making no
mistake Bravo can't believe it he got
smashed the first ball of the over and
he's finished it with a piece of
deception with a hand and it's a simple
catch for Johnson that really is full
marks for the bowler look at Bravo he
can't believe it he's got to
go that's in the air and should be taken
he will not miss it
not sure what he's trying to do
there Corin Pollard's back on the
boundary it's a comfortable catch Bud's
in the action again he loves it chadia
goes without
scoring that's up in the
air wickets falling like n pin
here Rohit sha taking the catch
easily short again tied him up in knots
handcuffed him and Johnson picks up his
second they need a partnership they need
a steadying
[Music]
partnership now how far man at long off
just oh I think for a major part of the
trajectory he would have thought hang on
maybe there's one coming my
way yes he's a big hitter he's a tonker
of the ball he's middled it and he was
pretty
confident now another man goes out at
Deep midwicket this deep Square leg and
he's knocked him over full that is a top
ball from p OA watch the celebration and
you can imagine why oh dear just wonder
if that is planned there because he's
run straight to the captain good
delivery Fuller delivery look at that
middle and off stom gone right in the
batting cre and look at the Mumbai
Indians stck out they are delighted and
look at this
man W oh what a ball now was there
something on it up goes the finger s
toel it is Je that wasn't a bad ball Mar
a do it's actually snaked
away come on sjin be our commentator for
this one and perfectly bow because he
sort of tempted him to to play against
the spin and uh you know he's he's also
beaten by bounce I though I'll come back
to you after this ball because you never
know so much is happening you slap that
over for six you must have got no option
but to play some big shots and and
calculate the amount of risk that
they're going to take
well that's a big big blow straight into
the
stands what is oza going to do look at
that high back lift look at that
connection sweetly of the
middle oh how's this for a hit it's gone
miles straight back over Po's
head Well's there there's
danger oh wow that is smashed
that's a monster shot that is a monster
shot simply
done in the calls for looking for runs
there's always a risk shot to
[Applause]
play oh that's a huge blow again from
ton he's going to leave his Mark little
Applause there from Dennis cartic and if
you're keeping stats on big H that was
our
672 yes Bank maximum hit and wasn't it a
big one so Hony on
53 his fourth six of this Innings so
powerful s back over his head again
muscular hitting this from
Tony well it's going to Dent Po's
figures
he's trying to recover from a situation
of 39
for6 yeah the game was really killed
dula trying to suggest ball in the sum
let's get this done
with and he managed to hit a boundary I
think that's a boundary and there comes
the Sprint they've got a big Squad of 30
members it's Mumbai Indians Rohit Sharma
the young Captain has done it the
support of two great vet
veterans they' managed to win their
first IPL sixth edition and Mumbai
Indians have finally won the title that
has been escaping here come the
fireworks sing there's the summary then
on
