349,Okay.,LABEL_2,2,LABEL_2,0.770136,0.924145,0.848289,0.736869
350,Yes.,LABEL_2,2,LABEL_2,0.88602,0.962387,0.924773,0.739339

352,So first I would say it's not just early signs because we're seeing returns obviously in the cloud business.,LABEL_2,2,LABEL_2,0.526566,0.843767,0.687533,0.734756
353,You've heard us talk about the fact that we already are generating billions of dollars from AI in the quarter and.,LABEL_2,2,LABEL_2,0.907486,0.96947,0.938941,0.735086
354,But then across the board we have a rigorous framework and approach by which we evaluate these long term investments that are meant to do two things.,LABEL_2,2,LABEL_2,0.883097,0.961422,0.922844,0.758165

356,So we look at it across the business.,LABEL_1,1,LABEL_1,0.637231,0.550286,0.090573,0.758852
357,"We evaluate the potential return for each one of them, whether it's in cloud.",LABEL_1,1,LABEL_1,0.542779,0.519117,0.028234,0.741025
358,"And I think that's more visible obviously externally, given that you see the revenue generated and the fact that we're unable to meet at this point customer demand, we have more demand than we have supplied in our ads business.",LABEL_2,2,LABEL_2,0.904962,0.968638,0.937275,0.764938

360,So we're excited to see what our investments are.,LABEL_2,2,LABEL_2,0.920168,0.973655,0.947311,0.785508
361,Investors are helping Advertisers as well.,LABEL_2,2,LABEL_2,0.555141,0.853197,0.706393,0.780457
362,YouTube where it's helping power recommendations.,LABEL_2,2,LABEL_2,0.819856,0.940553,0.881105,0.782465
363,"So when we make a decision on investment in the long term, we go through a very rigorous process of assessing what the return could be and over what time frame we will see that return to give us the high level of confidence to then invest and make those investments for the long term.",LABEL_2,2,LABEL_2,0.974954,0.991735,0.98347,0.806698

369,About 20% of Google's search queries are commercial historically and you've talked a bunch on this call about how AI overviews are kind of expanding the breadth of queries.,LABEL_2,2,LABEL_2,0.968478,0.989598,0.979195,0.822936
370,Could you talk about how new products on the monetization side like AI Max are potentially increasing the percent of commercial queries?,LABEL_1,1,LABEL_1,0.476281,0.497173,-0.015655,0.799676

372,"Separately, there is the question of whether queries actually increase with AI Mode.",LABEL_2,2,LABEL_2,0.694888,0.899313,0.798626,0.823759

375,"And I personally also see, this is what I just said in my last remark that I think over time there's an opportunity to actually take, let's say, queries that are not fully commercial but could have an adjacent commercial relationship to basically expand this into more attractive ads offerings while really creating a really interesting user experience at the same time.",LABEL_2,2,LABEL_2,0.931189,0.977292,0.954585,0.803351

377,I think AI overviews in AI mode are dramatically improving search.,LABEL_2,2,LABEL_2,0.720607,0.9078,0.8156,0.819955

380,Our next question comes from Ken Gurelski with Wells Fargo.,LABEL_2,2,LABEL_2,0.460084,0.821828,0.643655,0.807369

387,"Those all coexist and does the user, does the user eventually pick what mode they want?",LABEL_2,2,LABEL_2,0.681818,0.895,0.79,0.806189

393,"Obviously, search is evolving and between AI overviews and AI mode, I think we are able to give that range of experience for people in this moment.",LABEL_2,2,LABEL_2,0.839484,0.94703,0.89406,0.762041
394,"Over time, you can expect us to make the experiences simpler in a way that just like we did universal search many, many years ago, we may have done text search, image search, video search, et cetera, and then we kind of brought it together as universal search.",LABEL_2,2,LABEL_2,0.919989,0.973596,0.947193,0.784118
395,So you will see evolutions like that.,LABEL_2,2,LABEL_2,0.782256,0.928145,0.856289,0.781661
396,But I think we want to be sensitive to making sure we are meeting the users in terms of what they are looking for.,LABEL_2,2,LABEL_2,0.577552,0.860592,0.721184,0.800006
397,"I think Gemini allows us to build a more personal, proactive, powerful AI assistant for that moment.",LABEL_2,2,LABEL_2,0.86818,0.956499,0.912999,0.802441
398,"I think having the two surfaces, search and Gemini allows us to really serve users across the breadth of their needs and but over time we will thoughtfully look for opportunities to make the experience better for users.",LABEL_2,2,LABEL_2,0.882183,0.96112,0.922241,0.808289
399,"To the first part, I would broadly say, I do think we've been consistently saying for a while now this is an expansionary moment and we are seeing people engage more.",LABEL_1,1,LABEL_1,0.513241,0.509369,0.008739,0.78934
400,"And I think when they do that, naturally a portion of that information for users, those journeys are commercial in nature, so I would expect that to play out over time as well.",LABEL_2,2,LABEL_2,0.940594,0.980396,0.960792,0.797268
401,Our last question comes from Justin Post with baml.,LABEL_1,1,LABEL_1,0.456224,0.490554,-0.028892,0.778013

412,The first on the pace of frontier model research and development.,LABEL_2,2,LABEL_2,0.498558,0.834524,0.669048,0.787747
413,"Look, I think two things are both simultaneously true.",LABEL_2,2,LABEL_2,0.493916,0.832992,0.665985,0.782045

415,But it also is true at the same time that each of the prior model you're trying to get better over is now getting more and more capable.,LABEL_2,2,LABEL_2,0.798771,0.933594,0.867189,0.779695
416,"So I think both the pace is increasing, but sometimes we are taking the time to put out a notably improved model.",LABEL_2,2,LABEL_2,0.962873,0.987748,0.975496,0.786053
417,So I think that may take slightly longer.,LABEL_2,2,LABEL_2,0.476754,0.827329,0.654658,0.779594
418,But I do think the underlying pace is phenomenal to see.,LABEL_2,2,LABEL_2,0.477029,0.827419,0.654839,0.772909
419,And I'm excited about our Gemini 3.0 release later this year.,LABEL_2,2,LABEL_2,0.826478,0.942738,0.885476,0.794578

422,"And in terms of long term economics, I would say that again, us being a full stack AI player and the fact that we are developing highly differentiated products on our own technology I think will help us drive a good trajectory here as you have seen over the past few years.",LABEL_2,2,LABEL_2,0.911037,0.970642,0.941284,0.819268
