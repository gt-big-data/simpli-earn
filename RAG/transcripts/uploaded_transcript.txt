good afternoon everyone and welcome to
Tesla's fourth quarter 2024 Q&A webcast
my name is Travis axod the head of
investor relations here at Tesla and I
joined today by Elon Musk and B Tesa and
a nber of other Executives our Q4
results were announced at about 3 p.m.
central Time in the update deck we
published at the same link as this
webcast during this call we will discuss
our business Outlook and make
forward-looking statements these
comments are based on our predictions
and expectations as of today actual
events or results could differ
materially due to a nber of risks and
uncertainties including those mentioned
in our most recent filings with the
SEC during the question and answer port
of today's call please limit yourself to
one question and one followup please use
the raise hand button to join the
question que before we jp into Q&A
Elon has some opening remarks Elon 
thank you so in smary in Q4 we set a
record and delivered vehicles at an
annualized rate of nearly 2 million a
year  so congratulations to the Tesla
team on  excellent work re achieving
record production and deliveries  we
model y was the best selling vehicle of
of  any kind for 2024 that's worth
noting not just the best electric
vehicle the best vehicle of any kind on
Earth nber one with model y  we are
staying focused on on maximizing voles
and obviously doubling down
well I don't know
what really I I was going to say
doubling down on autonomy but really
it's like autonomy is like 10 Xing
things frankly doubling is not even
enough  we made many critical
investments in 2024 in manufacturing Ai
and Robotics that will  bear immense
fruit in the future immense like it's in
fact to such a scale that it is
difficult to
comprehend  and I've said this before
and I'll stand by it  I see a path I'm
not saying it's an easy path but I see a
path to Tesla being the most valuable
company in the world world by far not
even close like maybe several times more
than I mean
there is a path where Tesla is worth
more than the next top five companies
combined there's a path to
that I mean I I think it's like an
incredibly it's like a difficult path
but it is an achievable
path 
so  and that is overwhelmingly due to
autonomous vehicles and autonomous
hanoid
robots
so our focus is is is actually building
towards that
 and and that that's what we're laying
the ground We Lay the ground workor for
that in 2024 we'll continue to lay the
ground workor for that in
2025  in fact more than lay the ground
workor actually so we building the
structure be we're building the
manufacturing lines  and
 let you
know I'd like setting up for what I
think will be an epic
2026 and a ridiculous 27 and 28
ridiculously
good that is my
prediction
 and you know as you very few very few
people understand the value of full self
driving and our ability to monetize the
fleet  you you know I some of these
things I've said for quite a long time
and I know people have said well you
know he's the boy required wolf like
several times I'm telling you there's a
damn wolf this
time and you can drive it in fact it can
drive you it's a self-driving
wolf  you know for a lot of people
that they're like their experience of
Tesla autonomy  is is like if if it's
even a year old if it's even two years
old that it's like meeting it's like
meeting someone when they're like a
toddler and thinking that they're going
to be a toddler forever but obviously
they not going to be a toddler forever
they grow up but but if their last
experience was like oh FSD was a toddler
it's like well it's growing up now have
you seen it it's like walks and talks 
and  that's really what we've got 
and it's difficult to for people to
understand this because han intuition
is linear as opposed to what we're
seeing is exponential progress 
so that's why my nber one
recommendation for anyone who doubts is
simply try it have you tried it when's
last time you tried it and the only
people who are skeptical the only people
who are skeptical are those who have not
tried
it so you know a car goes a passenger
car typically has only about 10 hours of
utility per week out of
168  very small
percentage once that car is autonomous
 my rough estimate is that it is is in
use for at least a third of the hours of
the week so call it 50 maybe 55 hours of
the week  and it can be use for both
 Caro delivery and people delivery so
even let's say people are asleep but you
you can deliver packages in the middle
of the night or resupply restaurants or
whatever the case may be whatever people
need  at all hours of the day or night
 that same asset the thing that that
that is these things that already
exist with no incremental cost change
just a software update
now have five times or more the utility
than they currently
have I I am I I'm I think this will be
the
largest asset value increase in han
history maybe there's something bigger
but I'm I just don't know what it
is  and so people who look in the rear
view mirror  are looking for past
precedent except I I don't think there
is one so 
but you know the but but the reality of
autonomy is upon us and I repeat my
advice try driving the car or let it
drive
you  so now it it works very well in
the US but of course it will over time
work just as well everywhere
else

yeah 
so we're working hard to grow our annual
voles
 our constraint this year our current
constraint is battery packs this year
but we we're working on addressing that
constraint
 and I think we will make progress on
addressing that
constraint  and then things are really
going to go ballistic next year and
really ballistic in 27 and and 28 so
 yeah so a bit more on on full self
driving our Q4 Vehicle Safety report
shows continued year-over-year
Improvement in safety for vehicles so
that the safety nbers if somebody has
supervis full celf driving to an on or
not the safety differences are gigantic
 so  and people have seen the 
immense improvement with version 13 and
with incremental versions in version 13
and then version 14 is going to be yet
another Step Beyond that that is very
significant  we launched the cortex
training cluster at gigafactory Austin
which was a significant contributor to
FSD advancement  and we continue to
invest in training infrastructure out of
Texas
headquarters  so the the training
needs for Optimus or Optimus hanoid
robot are probably at least ultimately
10x
 what what's needed for the car at
least to get to the full range of of of
useful roles you can say like if how
many different roles are there for a
hanoid robot versus a car  hanoid
robot
is has probably well a
thousand times more uses and and more
complex things than in a car that that
doesn't mean the the training scales by
a thousand but
it's
probably you know 10x now you can do
this progressively so it doesn't mean
like Orel are going to spend like $500
billion in training Compu
  because we obviously train Optimus
to to do enough tasks to match the
output of Optimus
robots  but but and Ally the cost of
training is dropping dramatically with
time so but but it is it is 
like is one of those things where I
think longterm Optimus will
be Optimus has the potential to be north
of $1 trillion in Revenue like it's it's
really
bananas
 so then you can obviously afford a
lot of training compute in that
situation in fact even $500 billion
training compute in that situation would
be quite a good
deal

yeah the future is going to be
incredibly
different from the past that's for sure
we live at this unbelievable infection
point in han
history so
 yeah
so you know the proofs the proof is in
the pudding so we're going to be
launching unsupervised full
self-driving  as a paid service in
Austin in
June
so 
you have talked with the team we feel
confident in being able to do an initial
launch of unsupervised no one in the car
full self driving in Austin in June 
we already have  Teslas operating
autonomously onid full driving at our
Factory in Fremont and we'll soon be 
doing that at our Factory in
Texas so thousands of cars every day are
driving with no one in them at our
Fremont Factory
 in in California they will soon be
doing that in Austin  and then
elsewhere in the world the rest of our
factories which is pretty cool  and
the cars aren't just driving to exactly
the same spot because obviously it all
wouldn't Glide at the same
spot the cars are actually programmed
with with where with what Lane they need
to park into to be picked up for
delivery so they they drive from the
factory End of Line to their spe to
their destination parking spot and in
the and the for to be picked up for
delivery to
customers  and they're doing this
reliably every day thousands of times a
day it's pretty cool  like I said
these Teslas will be in the wild with no
one in them  in June in Austin
so what I'm saying is this is not some
far off mythical situation it's
literally H you know five six months
away five months away type of thing 
and while we're stepping at putting our
toe in the water gently at first just to
make sure everything's
cool  our solution our sort of a our
solution our solution is a general ized
AI solution it is not does not require
High Precision maps of a
locality  so we're just want to be
cautious it's not that it doesn't work
Beyond oron in fact it does we just want
to be put a toe in the water make sure
everything's okay then you know put a
few more toes in the water then put a
foot in the
water  with safety of the general
public as and those in the car as our
top priority
 with regard to
Optimus  obviously I'm making you know
these Revenue predictions predictions
that sound absolutely insane I realize
that 
but but they are I think they will prove
to be
accurate
 yeah  now now with Optimus there's
there's a lot of uncertainty on on the
exact timing because
you it's not like a train arriving at
the station for Optimus we are designing
the train and the station and in real
time while also bullying the
tracks and and so they're like why did
people should why didn't the train
arrive exactly at 12:05 and like we're
Lally designing the train and the track
in the station in real time while like
how can we predict this thing with
absolute Precision it's impossible 
you know the the normal internal plan
calls for roughly 10,000 Optimus robots
to be built this year will we succeed in
building 10,000 exactly by the end of
December this year  probably not we we
but I but will we succeed in making
several thousand yes I think we
will  will those several thousand
Optimus robots be doing useful things by
the end of the year yes I'm confident
they will they will do useful things
  that
those Optimus in use at the Tesla
factories  production design one will
inform how what we change for production
design two which we expect to launch
next year  and our goal is to ramp
prop Optimus production faster than
maybe anything's ever been ramped 
meaning like aspirationally an order of
magnitude ramp per year now if we aspire
to an order of magnitude R per year
perhaps we only end up with a half order
of B to per year but that's the kind of
growth that we're talking
about  it doesn't take very many years
before you know we're making a 100
million of these things a
year if you go up by let's say a factor
you know by 5x per
year it's insane insane not 50%
500% so you know these are Big growth
nbers
 yeah but we do need to this is an
entirely new supply chain it's is
entirely new technology there's nothing
off the cell shelf to use we try
desperately with Optimus to to use any
existing Motors act you know any any
actuators sensors nothing nothing worked
for a han right robot at any price we
had to design everything from from
physics first principles to work for a
hanoid robot  and with the most
sophisticated hand that has ever been
made before by
far
 right Optimus will be able to like
play the
piano  and and be able to thread a
needle I mean this is the level of
precision no one has been able to
achieve
 and so it's  it's really something
special 
so
 yeah so and my prediction long term
is that Optimus will be overwhelmingly
the value of the
company  regarding energy back up back
to
Earth

Elon have can you come back here for a
minute okay back to Earth U energy
storage is a big deal  will become
it's it's already super important will
become incredibly important in the
future and and it is something that
enables far greater energy output to the
grid than is currently possible 
because the the grid the the grids
are the vast majority of the grid has no
energy storage capability so they have
to design the power plants to for you
know for very high peaks  and assing
that there's no energy storage once you
have grid grid energy storage and home
based energy storage the actual total
energy output per year of the grid is
dramatically greater than people think
maybe it's it's at least double  this
will drive the demand of stationary 
battery packs and and especially the
grid scale ones to in insane basically
as much demand as we could possibly make

so  we
have our second Factory which is in in
Shanghai that's starting operation and
we're building a third Factory so we're
trying to ramp output of the stationary
battery storage as quickly as possible
now there is a challenge here where we
have to be careful to that we're not
robbing robbing for one pocket to take
to another pocket because for a given
gwatt hours per year of of sale output
we have S does it go into stationary
applications or mobile applications they
can't go both into both so we have to
make that tradeoff
 yeah
 but but over overall the demand for
total gwatt hours of batteries whether
mobile or stationary that will grow to
in in a very very big way over
time

so in conclusion  2025 really is is a
pivotal DEA for Tesla
and I and when people look back on 2025
and the launch of unsupervised felf
driving  true real world AI that that
actually
works I think they may regard it as the
biggest year in Tesla
history maybe even bigger than offest
car the Roadster or or the model the
model 3 or model
line that in fact I think it probably
will be viewed 25 as maybe the most
important year in tes
industry  there is no company in the
world that is as good at real world AI
as
Tesla I don't even know who's in second
place like you say like who's in second
place for real world AI I need a very
big telescope to see them that's how far
behind they
are all right great thank you very much
Elon and has some uping remarks as well
yeah I'll talk about things on earth
as Elon mentioned in Q4 we set records
in vehicle deliveries and energy storage
deployments in an uncertain macro
environment we were able to grow Auto
and energy storage voles both
sequentially and on a year on-ear basis
for this I would like to thank the
efforts of everyone at Tesla to make
this a reality and our customers who
helped us achieve this fed coming into
the fourth quarter our Focus was to
reduce inventory levels in the
automotive business and we accomplished
that by ending the quarter with the
lowest finished good inventory in the
last two years this was a result of
offering not only attractive financing
options but also other discounts and
programs which impacted asps while we
saw vole growth in almost all regions
that we operating we hit a new record of
for deliveries in the greater China
Market this is an encouraging Trend
since we grew vole in a highly
competitive BB Market on the automotive
margin front we saw a quar or quarter
decline primarily due to lower asps and
due to the recognition of FSD related
Revenue in Q3 from feuture releases our
journey on cost reduction continues and
we were able to get our overall cost per
car down below
$35,000 driven primarily by material
cost this was despite increased
depreciation and other costs as we
prepare for the transition to the new
model y for which we recently started
taking orders in all markets all our
factories will start producing the new
model y next month while we feel
confident in our team's abilities to
ramp production quickly know that it is
an unprecedented change and we're not
aware of anybody else taking the
bestselling car on the planet and
updating all factories at the same
time this change over will result in
several weeks of lost production in the
quter as a result margins will be
impacted due to idle capacity other ramp
related cost as is common in any launch
but will be overcome as production is
ramped we'll be introducing several new
products throughout 2025 we are still on
track to launch a more affordable model
in the first half of 2025 and we'll
continue to expand our lineup from there
on a dollar for dollar basis we believe
we have the most compelling lineup today
compared to the industry and it will
continue to get better from here as
always all our products come with the
best software in the industry autonomy
features and capable of full autonomy in
the future and despite the premi
experience the total cost of ownership
is close to mass Market less premi
competitors energy storage deployments
reached in alltime high in
Q4 and this and resulted in  but
declined sequentially this was a result
of high  this sorry growth came from
AP pack and power both businesses
continue to be Supply constrainted and
like Elon mentioned we're trying to ramp
up production with mega Factory 
Shanghai coming online  this quarter
onwards while quarterly deployments will
likely continue to fluctuate
sequentially we expect at least 50%
growth in deployments year-over year in
2025 gross profit and margins in the
service and other business was up
year-over-year but declined sequentially
this was the result of higher service
enter cost and lower profit from used
car business the businesses within
service and other primarily support our
new car business especially through
their impact on total cost of ownership
therefore while we manage them to be
positive on a gap basis we do not expect
similar margins as the rest of the
business there's a lot of uncertainty
around tariffs over the years we've
tried to localize our supply chain in
every Market but we are still very
reliant on parts from across the the
world for all our businesses therefore
the imposition of tariffs which is very
likely and any reciprocity will have an
impact on our business and
profitability our operating expenses
grew both year-over-year and
sequentially the biggest drival of the
increase was R&D as we continue to
invest in AI related
initiatives the remaining increase came
from growth in our sales capabilities
and marketing efforts from referral
program
for 2025 we expect operating expenses to
increase to support our growth
initiatives it is important to point out
that the net income in Q4 was impacted
by a 600 million Mark to Market benefit
from Bitcoin due to the adoption of a
new accounting standard for digital
assets whereby we'll change we'll take
Mark to Market adjustments through other
income every reporting period going
forward our free cash flow for the
quarter was 2 billion and despite cap
increase of over 2.4 billion in 2024 we
were able to generate free cash flow of
3.6 billion for the year capex effic
efficiency is something we are extremely
focused on while we have invested in AI
related initiatives we've done so in a
very targeted manner to to utilize this
spend to get immediate benefits the
buildout of Cortex was accelerated
because of the
role actually help accelerate the 
roll out of FSD V version 13 a
culative AI related capex including
infrastructure so far has been
approximately 5 billion and for 2025 we
expect our capex to be flat on a year
year
basis in conclusion you know like Elon
said 2025 is going to be a pivotal year
for Tesla there are a lot of Investments
which we made and will continue to make
in this coming year which will set the
pace for the next face of growth and you
know it is something which now I'm
getting out out of Earth it is going to
be out of this world and we just are
playing putting the light foundation and
that's all I have great thank you very
much viov  now we will move over to
investor questions  and we'll start
with say.com the first question is  is
unsupervised FSD still planed to be
released in Texas and California this
year what hurdles still exist to make
that happen
you address the Texas piece I think
already so yeah I'm confident that we
will release UNS supervised Fs in
California  this year as well
 you know yeah in fact I think we
will most likely release unsupervised
FSD in many regions of the country of
the US by the end of this year  like I
said we're just putting a toe in the
water then few toes then put then leg
then you know make sure everything's
cool  and
 we we're looking for a safety level
that is significantly above the average
han driver so it's not anywhere like
much safer not like a little bit safer
than han way safer than
han  so the standard has to be very
high because the moment there's any kind
of you know accident with an autonomous
car this
immediately gets worldwide headlines
even though about 40,000 people die
every year in car accidents in the US
and that most of them don't even get a
mention
anywhere but if somebody scrapes a shin
with an autonomous car it's it's
headline
use we want why that
yeah  so it's really from an ex the
only thing holding us back is an excess
oftion  but people can suddenly get a
feel for how well the car would perform
as unsupervised FSD by Simply Having car
allowing the car to drive you around
your city and see how many times did you
have to intervene not where you wanted
to intervene or were a little concerned
but how many times do you have to
intervene for for definite safety
reasons and you will find that that is
currently very rare  and over time
almost
never great thank you very much the next
question is  are there any discussions
with other auto companies about
licensing FSG
yes what we're seeing
is at this point significant interest
from a nber of major car companies
about
licensing Tesla full soft driving
technology  what we generally said is
the best way to know what to do is take
one of our cars
apart  and and then you can see where
the placement of the cameras are what
the thermal needs are of the Tesla AI
Ander computer  that's better than us
you know sending some CAD drawings 
and  and then we're only going to
entertain situations where the vole
would be very high otherwise it is not
worth the complexity  and and we will
not  burden our engineering team with
 laborious discussions with other
engineering teams until we obviously
have UNS supervis will self-driving
working throughout the United States
 I think the interest level from other
manufacturers to license FSD will be
extremely high once it is obvious that
unless you have FSD you're
dead great thank you very much  the
next question is is Optimus now mostly
design locked for 2025
production  Optimus is not design
locked
so when I say like we're we're designing
the train as it's going we're we're
redesigning the train as it's going down
the tracks while redesigning the tracks
and the train
stations weol the yeah it's it's it's
rapidly evolving it's rapidly evolving
in a good direction  you know it's
it's pretty pretty damn amazing actually
team's doing a fantastic job  we
really have by far I think by far the
best team of hanoid robotics engineers
in the world
 and and we also have all the other
ingredients necessary you know because
you need a you know great battery pack
you need great Power Electronics you
need great charging capability you need
 you know great Communications good
have Wi-Fi and cellular
connectivity
 and  and of course you need real
world
AI  and then the ability to scale that
production  to sign to to huge levels
 so you have to design for
manufacturing the things that I mean
really what what other companies are
missing is they're missing the real
world Ai and they missing the ability to
 scale manufacturing to millions of
units a
year I think that is an underappreciated
thing that industrialization of design
is a whole different thing than making a
design yeah prototypes are trivial
basically  prototypes are easy
production is hot I've said that for
many years
 the problem is that there like those
who have never been involved in
production or manufacturing  somehow
think that may you once you come up with
some Eureka design that you magically
can make a million units a year  and
this is totally false the there needs to
be some that some holwood story or where
they show actually the problem is
manufacturing I never even heard of one
is is you know it's just doesn't fit the
narrative the Hollywood thing is like
it's like some loan inventor in a garage
goes
Eureka and suddenly it files a patent
and suddenly there's millions of units I
like I'm listen to guys we're missing Mo
really 99% of the
story 1% is you know that old saying one
like a product is 1% inspiration 99%
postp spiration the Hollywood CHS you
the 1% inspiration and minus but forgets
about the 99% proration of actually
figuring out how to make that initial
prototype manufacturable and then
manufactured at high vole such that
the product is reliable low cost
consistent doesn't break down all the
time and that is 100 times harder at
least than the Prototype then you have
to get it there deliver it back yeah
yeah you got to meet all these
regulations and there zlion Regulators
around the world it's veryy
difficult great thank you  the next
question is also Optimus related  when
will Tesla start selling Optimus  and
what will the price
P well the it may for for this year we
expect just close the loop with Optimus
being used internally at Tesla 
because we obviously can easily use
several thousand hanoid robots at
Tesla for you know like the most boring
annoying tasks in the factory like the
task nobody wants to
do where we have to like beg people to
do this task and and then they that it's
like like the robot's totally happy to
do the boring dangerous repetitive task
that no no hans want to do
 and and that's also actually some of
the easiest use cases for us to you know
have have Optimus  do things like you
know like load load the the hopper like
like for you know like say in body line
if you're like transporting you know
pieces of sheet metal to
the the Rob which is already robot the
robot welding line for the body and you
just have to non-stop take things out of
out of a  for one fixture to another
fixture and it's a very boring
job  that's the kind of thing what
Optimist could do  the guy who runs
arounds all the wealth STS and in the
pends yeah there's there's a ton of
boring jobs tedious jobs danger you know
slightly dangerous jobs that that's
perfect for Optimus so we expect to use
Optimus for those tasks at our factories
and and and that'll help us close loop
for improvement this year  it's really
with prod production version
two which I think launches sometime next
year  I'd like to be the beginning of
next year but maybe it's more like the
middle of next year  and and then we
have to just with a with a production
line that is designed for you know on
the order of 10,000 units a month versus
a th000 units a month so like when you
design a unit for like when you a
production line for 1,000 units a month
it it takes you a while to actually
reach anywhere close to 1,000 units a
month  when when you design and for
any given production output  it takes
you a while to actually reach its
potential  but the the current line
that we're designing is for roughly a
th000 units a month of of Optimus robots
the next line would be for 10,000 units
a month the line after that would be for
100,000 units a month
 and I think probably with with
version
two it's a very rough guess because
there's so much uncertainty here very
rough guess that we start delivering
Optimus robots
to companies that are outside of Tesla
in the maybe the second half of next
year something like that but but like
this is such an exponential R that'll go
from no one's receiving hanoid robots
to these things like coming out like
crazy so we can't build enough well
we're always going to be in the we can't
build enough
situation
 demand will not be a problem even at
a high price and and then as I said like
once we start once we're at a steady
state of above a million units a
year  I I think the production I'm
confident at a million units a year that
the production cost of Optimus will be
less than
$20,000 if you compare the complexity of
op to the complexity of of a car so just
the total mass and complexity  of
Optimus is is is much less than a car so
I would expect that at similar voles
to say the model Y which is over a
million units a year that You' see
Optimus be I don't know half the half
the cost or be something like that what
what the price of Optimus is is a
different matter the price of Optimus
will be set by the market to
great thank you very much the next
question is  what is the  status on
mass production of the tesl semi  and
how will it impact  Revenue at
scale I can say that one so we just
closed up the semi Factory roof and
walls last week in Reno  that a
schedule which is great with the weather
in Reno you never know what's going to
happen but we're prepping for mechanical
installation of all the equipment in the
coming months  the first builds of the
high vole semi design will come late
this year in 2025 and begin ramping
early in 2026 but as we've said before
you know the semi is a TCO no-brainer 
it it'ss really similar to Optimus it's
you know set by how much people pay and
then you know it as a total cost of
ownership it's much much cheaper than
any other Transportation you can have so
at that point  when we're at scale it
will meaningly contribute to you know
Tesla's Revenue I think it's difficult
to say how
much anything you want to add
 no I
mean I do think it tells a semi again
with autonomy is going to be incredibly
valuable  you know that we actually
have a shortage of truck drivers in
America that's one of the limiting
factors on transport  and
 you know and and people are han so
they get tired and sometimes and you
know
there's it's you know I have a lot of
respect for Tr drivers because it's a
tough job  but because it's a tough
job there's not that many people that
want to do it and there's actually a
fewer I believe if I my saying is
correct there are fewer people entering
truck driving as a profession than are
leaving it yes so when you think yeah
exactly so so when you consider okay
there's more people leaving truck
driving as a profession than entering it
well we're going to have a real
Logistics problem as time goes by so 
autonomy will be very important to meet
that that need
so like yeah
it'll I don't know it's it's it's it's a
several billion a year opportunity which
I don't know in this context is
that these days several billion a year
matter I think it
does not
nothing it's probably you know might
it's probably like a 10 billion year
thing a billion a month at some point
probably but but it's it's you know all
this is going to pale in comparison to
Optimus
so yeah the billion a month is it's a
lot but it's it's not it's going to be
like 1% of Optimus or something you
know great thank you very much  we
already covered the next question  and
go any remarks  so moving on  is it
expected that Tesla will need to upgrade
Hardware 3 vehicles and if so  what is
the timeline and
expected impact  to Tesla's capex I
think referring to cost
there they're really asking the tough
questions all
they I I guess we you know we haven't
stopped working on Hardware 3 yet we are
still  making software releases we
released the 12.6 release recently which
was like it's like a baby  v13  but
it's a significant Improvement compared
to what they had previously  and you
know people are still finding ways to
distill larger models into smaller
models so we not given up on Hardware 3
we still working on it  just the
releases will Trail the hardware for
releases thanks yeah I mean I think the
honest
answer is that we're gonna have to
upgrade people's  Hardware 3 computer
for those that are board full
self-driving and that is the honest
answer and that's going to be painful
and difficult but we'll get it
done  now I'm kind of glad that not
that many people bought the FSD pack
thanks Elon  the next question  has
Tesla given up on ramping their solar
roof
product 
no sorry Mike oh Mike go ahead yeah oh
yeah I can take it  yeah solar roof
remains a core part of the residential
product portfolio and it still remains
 or it draws a lot of customer
interest despite it being premi
products  we've worked on multiple
iterations of engineering to make the
product easier to install and distribute
 by reducing the skew count and you
know more recently rather than direct
installation we are focused on growth
through our Nationwide network of
certified installers and many of those
 they've been installing solar roof
with us for many
years yeah that's actually turned out to
be a much better way for the like is
just let the roof just Supply product to
the roofing industry  and especially
when somebody's going to is is getting a
new roof anyway or or building a house
from scratch obviously this is by far
the most efficient  time to put in a
solar roof as opposed to putting a solar
roof on a house that where the roof
still has you know 20 years of life 
that that's not economically senseful
but  but but if it's a new house or
the roof needs to be replaced anyway
then solar roof can make a lot of sense
 and
 and and it is it is a premi product
it's it's like the yeah it's kind of
like Model S model X or something it's
like a a pre it's a premi product  I
think it looks really cool and your
house I mean your house generates
electricity and if you combine it with
the Tesla power W battery then you can
be self-sufficient so even if the grid
turns off even if the grid turns off for
several days your house still
works and your roof looks
awesome so it's like I recommend anyone
who who can afford it get the Tesla Sol
roof and the power
wall your family's life might depend on
it get enough and and just and just in
terms of convenience you know your kids
are not going to yell at you because
their computers don't work because the
power went out and and you can't charge
your phone true actually
happens yeah you literally can't even
call anyone because your phone's out of
juice thank you very much  the next
question was  covered in opening
remarks so we will skip that and the
last question from say.com  what
technical breakthroughs will Define v14
of FSD given  that v13  already
covered Photon to
control well we're going to have
look how about further than than photons
to
Upward we've been in sort of the nothing
but Net's situation nothing but neural
Nets from photons to controls for a
while now we're just improving the
neural Nets
 I guess we could get into some of the
technical details to some degree  I
have to say I I continue to be amazed by
just how effective autoaggressive
Transformers are at solving a wide range
of
problems I mean a sh is anything you'd
like to add there without giving away
the sort of family secrets I except all
things we put on X  yeah continue to
scale the model size  a lot  you
know we scale a bunch in v13 but then
there's still room to grow  so we're
going to continue to scale the model
size we're going to increase the context
length even more  the memory is sort
of like limited right now we only
increase the amount of memory  P to
even minutes of  context for driving
 we're going to add audio emergency
vehicles better add like data  of the
tricky Corner cases that we get from the
entire fleet you know any interventions
or any kind of like you know us
intervention  we just add that to the
data data set  okay so the scaling in
basically every access training compute
data set size model size model context
 and also all the reinforcement and
the
objectives great all righty  with that
we will move over to analyst questions
 so just as a reminder  you will
need to unmute yourself to ask your
question  the first question will be
coming from Daniel Rosa from Bernstein
 Daniel please go ahead and unmute
yourself hey good evening every
everybody it's Danel from Bernstein 
Elon Tesla share price clearly already
includes quite few of the anticipated
benefits you talked about today  yet
realizing what you call kind of
difficult but achievable will take some
time what are you pushing the Tesla
executive team to do differently now to
accelerate the innovation in order to
realize the value you describe for the
company well I mean
we're 
working on perfecting real world Ai and
making rapid progress week over week if
not you know certainly month over month
but often week over week
 I I spent a lot of time with the
Tesla AI team and the Tesla Optimist
team I mean I go where the problem is
essentially like  not you know if
something's this is hit un porun
sometimes like don't talk to tell the
executive and like hey we don't see you
very often I'm like that's because your
stuff is working awesome 
yourself working really your grade
unfortunately I don't see them very
often because I go where the problem is
so
 you know one the problem is what like
what's what's the greatest challenge
that lies ahead so obviously there's
there's there there are many challenges
with the Optimus it's a hard problem to
solve  many challenges for with
vehicle autonomy but we're making rapid
progress on both 
yeah
 okay I mean sounds like you You'
you've got a conviction that the pieces
you need right are are in place yeah 
if we kind of go 12 months down the line
and we look back and you had some of
those but maybe what are the kind of two
or three kpis that would tell you that
you know you're on track and it's going
the right way and the pieces you've put
in place are the right pieces right
that's kind of what I'm looking for 
or other way around
where would it be of most likely in your
mind that you say hey I need to go back
there and I need to change something to
enable the team
better well I mean I think my the
predictions that I'm making here are are
going to be pretty accurate
 you know and it's worth like
sometimes people say oh elan's always
late well actually no the problem is
that the media reports on when I'm late
but never reports on when I'm early 
so sure I'm optimistic but I'm not that
optimistic  you know there are many
cases in the past where actually we've
been early you know such as completion
of the Shanghai Factory  or  fact
Factory completion has generally been
ahead of schedule not behind 
so
 yeah so so
the but but I I like I said I'm very
confident we'll have released UNS
supervis self-driving fully aous Teslas
in in Austin and several other cities in
America by the end of this year 
that's probably everywhere in America
next year and everywhere in North
America at least I I think in terms of
next year our constraint I think is
likely to be just
regulatory  you know like like like
Europe really has for example Europe is
a layer cake of of regulations and
bureaucracy  which really needs to be
addressed  you know this this
 you know joke like America innovates
Europe
regulates it's like guys  there's too
many refs on the field  I mean for
example for us just to release un just
just to release supervised full self
driving in Europe even though it works
really well  we have we have to go
through a mountain of paperwork with the
Netherlands which is our primary
regulatory Authority then the
Netherlands presents this to the EU I
think
May  and there's like this big EU
country committee we expect it to be
approved  at that time but there's
nothing we can do to make that may
happen
sooner in fact nobody seems to do if but
I guess all the countries would have to
somehow vote in some way to have it
happen sooner than
May otherwise won't happen sooner than
me so then then when is unsupervised FSC
a lowed in Europe I'm
like May next year maybe I don't
know well I have to find out when the EU
is meeting a game  sometimes it's a
12-month Cadence sometimes a six-month
Cadence  then you know China which is
a a gigantic Market  we do have some
challenges because they won't currently
allow us to transfer training video
outside of China and then the US
government won't let us do training in
China so we're in bit of a bind
there
 like what of a quandry so so what
we're solving that is  by
literally looking
at  videos of streets in China that
are available on the
internet to understand and and then
feeding that into our radio training so
that publicly available video of street
SS and traffic rules in China can be can
be used for
training  and then also putting it
into we've got a very accurate U
simulator and and so it we'll train
using SIM for you know bus lanes in
China like bus lanes in China by the way
what about the biggest challenges in
making  FSD work in China is is the
bus lanes are are very complicated 
and and there's like literally like
hours of the day that you're allowed to
be there and not be there and then if
you accidentally go in there boss Lane
at the wrong time the the you get an
automatic ticket
instantly so it's kind of a big deal BOS
Lanes in China  so we have put that
into our  simulator train on that 
the car has to know what time of date it
is read the sign  anyway we'll get
this solved  but
 you know I think we'll have uniced
FSD in almost every Market this year
 limited simply by regulatory
issues  not technical
capability and then then unsupervised
FSD in the US this year in many cities
but Nationwide next year  and and
hopefully we have unsupervised FSD in
most countries by the end of next year
that that's the that's my prediction
with best data that I have right
now great thank you very much
the next question will come from Adam
Jonas at Morgan Stanley  Adam please
feel free to unmute
yourself  thanks everybody so Elon
you've said in the past about
liar that for AVS at least that lar is a
crutch a Fool's errand I think you even
told me once even if it was free you'd
say you wouldn't use it you still feel
that way
yes care to elaborate or just I have
another question
 look we even have a radar in the car
and we turned it
off I got it all right so you're you're
still yeah people think you're crazy you
know but 
 for
not obviously hans drive without
shooting lasers out of their
eyes I mean unless you're Superman 
you know but but like hans drive just
with passive
visual hans drive with with eyes and a
neural net and a brain neural net so
sort of biological C which so the
digital equivalent of eyes and a brain
are cameras and  and and digital
neural Nets or AI  so that's the
entire Road system was designed for
Passive Optical neural Nets that's how
the whole RO system was not designed and
what everyone is expecting other that's
how we expect other costs to behave so
therefore that is very obviously the
solution  for for self-driving in as a
generalized for the generalized solution
for full self driving as opposed to the
very specific you know neighborhood by
neighborhood solution which is very
difficult to maintain which is what our
competitors are doing

 yeah yeah Ian Nar doesn't work in the
fall guys  yeah nidar has a lot of
issues I don't know if so like like the
SpaceX Dragon ducks with the space
station using lar that a a program that
I personally spear I don't have some
fundamental bizarre dislike of lar it's
simply the wrong solution for driving
cars on roads right you you understand
how how lar works I I get literally
designed and built ear red lar I overa
the project the engineering of thing 
I it was my decision to use lar and
dragon and I over saw that that
engineering project directly and so I'm
like we literally designed and made a
rad a light on to do with space station
I thought it was the right solution for
cars I would do that but it isn't got
all right just as a followup at at
CES  you said I paraphrasing that any
AI will be able to do any cognitive task
not involving atoms within the next
three or four years and that would imply
Elon that before the end of  president
Trp's term in office that AI would be
moving pretty damn quickly into the
physical world into the world of photons
and atoms and I'm thinking given your
work with the administration how come
confident are you that the US has will
have the manufacturing and the supply
base to to make good on your excitement
about physical AI by the you know end of
by latter of this decade we seem pretty
vulnerable right now I've seen you
Tweeting about or sorry Xing excuse me
Elon about China  frud and slip about
China having like making more drones in
a day than the US makes in a year and
all the entanglement of the supply so
what has to happen in the US to make
that possible what's your message and 
what can what can you do about it and
what's relevant for Tesla shareholders
thanks
El well a Tesla obviously we think
manufacturing is cool  SpaceX we think
manufacturing is cool  but in general
for talented Americans  they need to
Beyond you know my beyond my companies
Beyond me and the people and my teams
here in general we need to make
manufacturing pool game  in America 
and
you know like I honestly think people
should move from like law and finance
into manufacturing that's my honest
opinion we have too much this is both a
compliment and a criticism we have too
much talent in L and engineer LW and
Finance in America and there should be
more of that talent in
manufacturing 
so
 yeah
 I mean tell that we're making sure
that  we can continue to manufacture
our stuff  even in the event of
geopolitical tensions  rising to very
high
levels great thank you very much  the
next question will come from Pierre faru
at New Street  Pierre please feel free
to unmute
yourself hey thanks guys start taking
the question  so I have a question you
on  dipl like robotex is in in June in
in htin so that's great news and I was
wondering if it means I can you know
drive down to htin in June and try 
and try U unsupervised by myself with my
car or it's going to be more
like your Fleet testing
it it it'll be our Fleet testing it 
that's our sort of toe in the water 
you know we scrutinizing it very
carefully make sure it's not something
we missed  but it will be you know
ride autonomous ride healing for money
in in Austin in June  and then as
swiftly as possible other cities in
America and I expect us to be operating
doing
unsupervised  activity with with u
with our internal Fleet in several
cities by the end of the year  then
that's probably next year when when
people are able to add or subtract their
car from the fleet so you know kind of
like Airbnb where you can sort of out or
subtract your house or guest room  you
know you can say like out of the Airbnb
inventory or or don't add the inventory
 you know if if you're if you're
traveling for a month you
can or whatever in case maybe you can
let other people use your house  
and and then you anyway so like that's
probably next year because we want to
just make sure we've ironed out any any
kinks  and a lot of it is it's not
like we're not splitting the atom here
it's just a bunch of work that needs to
be done to make sure the whole thing
works efficiently that people can order
the car it it comes you know to the
right spot does exactly the right thing
full of payment systems work the billing
Works
 yeah 
okay but then like so my thought
question would be you know I I have a
Tesla I have a SD and I have to keep my
eyes on the on the road all the time
it's super boring because I don't really
need to intervene anymore and  but the
really annoying thing is that I can't
just check my emails and so are you
working also on introducing you know
like a kind of like free unsupervised
where I could be eyes of and and I I
would be able to check my email and
would just need to with a 5sec notice
have to go back and keep an eye on
what's happening or is that something
you're working on as well because it
feels so closed with with V3 that I
wonder if it's something we could expect
for this year it's very selfish question
I asked for myself to be honest  yes
we just need we need to be very
confident that the probability of injury
is low before  we allow people to to
check check that they email and text
messages in fact right now we're in this
perverse situation which you may have
encountered yourself where  people
actually go to manual driving to check
their text messages yep so the computer
doesn't yell at
them and then go then put it back on
autonomous mode once they've checked the
Tex text messages which is obviously
less safe significantly significantly
less safe significantly less safe than
just letting people check their text
once in a while  without the computer
yelling at them  but we just want to
be cautious about that at the Advent of
that we're in this sort of you know
neither here nor
there but just for I mean I think it's
not for many months longer
 but yeah we're in in this perverse
situation where people will turn the car
off autopilot so the computer doesn't
yell at them check their text text
messages while while steering the car
with their knee and not looking out the
window
and like like Elon said right if you
have any problems with the system and
when people are not looking that is a
dangerous thing and that's what we're
trying to avoid it's the capability is
getting there but it's not fully there
that's why he was using the term of
Dipping a toe in the water then getting
comfortable then
keep anyway it's it's it's not far off
 but we would want to prove to
ourself you Pro prove to ourselves and
obviously prove to Regulators that the
car is unequivocally
safer  in autonomous mode than than
not
 and that's we're not far off so this
is like low single digit
months to the safety aspect we did
publish our sa  Vehicle Safety report
today and Q4 was one crash for every 5.9
million miles driven compared to a crash
every 700,000 miles without public pilot
right we're getting to the point where
it's an order of yeah it's like 8.5 tons
see so it's just about there yeah it's
amazing great all righty and  our last
question will be coming from  Dan Levi
at barklay  Dan feel free to unmute
yourself great  good evening thank you
for taking the questions Elon You'
talked about the need for proliferation
of sustainable transport in the past as
part of sort of broader push to
sustainable energy  I know we've heard
a lot about  president Trp's plans
to reverse the the EV mandate and I
think there's a view that given 
regulation is a driver of EV uptake this
could slow EV uptake in the US so 
what would be your view on on the right
policy in in the US given  your
comments in the past of the need to push
for sustainable
transport  you know at this point I
think the that sustainable transport is
inevitable  I'm highly confident that
all
transport  will be autonomous electric
including aircraft and that it simply
it's it can't be stopped any more than
one could have stopped the Advent of the
external combustion engine the steam
engine or or or one could have stopped
the Advent of the internal combustion
engine  like like even if you've been
the biggest horse Advocate on Earth you
like like
a horses are the way not these new
fangled car
automobiles the you can't stop the
Advent of the automobile it's going to
happen  and you can't you can't stop
the Advent of electric cars it's going
to happen  the only holding back
electric cars was range and that is a
Sol
problem
great  and then as a followup  you
know in the past Elon you had made a
comment that you know you'd be willing
to sell cars effectively no margin to
get the cars out there and there's a
comment in the release today of  the
rate of acceleration of atony efforts
does impact vole growth so perhaps you
could just talk about you know with your
efforts on
FSD  how we should think about your
desire to put more Vehicles out in in
the market to  take advantage of your
of your Tech
advances so I'm not sure I understand
the question  we have a lot of cars I
me we've got millions of cars out there
 so is is your question then that how
do we how do we marry our future growth
aspects with
FSD and go ahead and unmute yourself
Dan yeah more so just how much more
aggressively you would be wish willing
to  you know sell your cars versus
versus  you know in light of your of
your improvements on
FSD well right now the constraint we're
trying to solve is battery production 
as opposed to demand so
we're and now q1 we've got this massive
factory retooling for the new model y
for example that obviously has a
short-term impact on output  but 
the problem we're wrestling with in fact
we're
talking that you the executive team and
I were talking about just before this
call was how we got to figure out how to
increase total gwatt hours of of battery
production this year one way or another
that's the constraint on our
output great all righty and with that 
I think we are all done for today so 
thanks everyone so much for all of your
questions we look forward to talking to
you next quarter  thank you very much
and goodbye
